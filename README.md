# Getting Started with Transformers

This is a tutorial for getting started with [ðŸ¤— Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). It is adapted and condensed from the fantastic [ðŸ¤— Transformers course](https://github.com/huggingface/course). Examples from this course have been extracted and adopted to work on Princeton Research computing clusters.
